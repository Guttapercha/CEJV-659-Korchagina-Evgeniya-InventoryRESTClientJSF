NM=Absolutely perfect in every way. Never been played and usually sealed.
M=The record has been on a shelf between other records. The vinyl looks glossy and clearly has only been played a few times. There are no marks on the vinyl and the whole package is complete.
E=Same but I\u2019d tolerate very light marks where the vinyl has been in and out of the inner sleeve a few times, or tiny signs of use generally.
VG+=A few further faults are acceptable, but nothing that really compromises the record visually or audibly. A little rub, light inaudible marks, a little background crackle.
VG=It\u2019s seen a bit of life, but is still usable. Light pops and clicks, an edge split, light visible scratches. You can still listen to it and enjoy looking at it, but it is visually and audibly USED.
G=To be honest you\u2019re making trouble for yourself here, as Good means Bad. I\u2019d only be selling something really desirable in this condition, with a bargain price and a full, no holds barred description to match.
P=Attempting to listen will be a disturbing experience. Expect major noise issues, skipping or repeating. The record itself is cracked, badly warped and has deep scratches. The cover is also approaching death.
